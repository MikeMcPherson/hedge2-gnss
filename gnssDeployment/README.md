# gnssDeployment Application

This deployment was auto-generated by the F' utility tool.

## Building and Running the gnssDeployment Application

In order to build the gnssDeployment application, or any other F´ application, we first need to generate a build directory. This can be done with the following commands:

```
cd gnssDeployment
fprime-util generate
```

The next step is to build the gnssDeployment application's code.
```
fprime-util build
```

## Running the application and F' GDS

The following command will spin up the F' GDS as well as run the application binary and the components necessary for the GDS and application to communicate.

```
cd gnssDeployment
fprime-gds
```

To run the ground system without starting the gnssDeployment app:
```
cd gnssDeployment
fprime-gds --no-app
```

The application binary may then be run independently from the created 'bin' directory.

```
cd gnssDeployment/build-artifacts/<platform>/bin/
./gnssDeployment -a 127.0.0.1 -p 50000
```
